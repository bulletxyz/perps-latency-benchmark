# Perps Latency Benchmark

Benchmark crypto perps order submission latency.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.25+
- `uv` for live Hyperliquid/Lighter/Extended runs; Python 3 for Aster
- Venue accounts funded and configured before using `--confirm-live`

Long-running services should prefer direct Python interpreters over resident
`uv run` wrappers once dependencies are installed. Set `PERPS_BENCH_PYTHON` to
a shared Python command prefix; matching `uv run ... python
internal/venues/<venue>/...` commands will execute through that prefix.

## Quick Start

Generate local wallet material:

```bash
go run ./cmd/perps-bench accounts generate \
  --venues hyperliquid,lighter \
  --out .env.wallets.local
```

Print the setup checklist. This shows the public wallet identifiers you need for
venue setup.

```bash
go run ./cmd/perps-bench accounts checklist \
  --venues hyperliquid,lighter \
  --env-file .env.wallets.local
```

Complete the venue-side setup:

- Hyperliquid: register or approve the printed EVM wallet if needed, fund the
  Hyperliquid account or agent wallet, then adjust the BTC order params in
  `examples/hyperliquid-builder.json` if needed.
- Lighter: use the printed Ethereum address for account creation/deposits,
  generate an API key in Lighter, fill `LIGHTER_PRIVATE_KEY`,
  `LIGHTER_ACCOUNT_INDEX`, and `LIGHTER_API_KEY_INDEX` in `.env.wallets.local`,
  optionally set `LIGHTER_MAKER_PRIVATE_KEY` and
  `LIGHTER_MAKER_API_KEY_INDEX` for a maker-only key,
  then adjust the BTC order params in `examples/lighter-builder.json` if
  needed.

Verify that required local environment is present:

```bash
go run ./cmd/perps-bench accounts check \
  --venues hyperliquid,lighter \
  --env-file .env.wallets.local
```

Run a benchmark:

```bash
go run ./cmd/perps-bench run \
  --config examples/hyperliquid-builder.json \
  --env-file .env.wallets.local \
  --confirm-live
```

Swap the config file for another configured venue, for example:

```bash
examples/lighter-builder.json
examples/aster-builder.json
examples/extended-builder.json
examples/bullet-builder.json
```

The starter configs use small post-only orders. Keep them small until account
setup is confirmed. Cleanup runs after each measured submit, outside the
latency window.

Post-only builder configs should derive price from the venue book instead of a
fixed BTC level. Set `post_only_price_source` to `book_top` to enable the warm
book-top stream, `post_only_price_offset_bps` for the maker-safe distance from
best bid/ask, and `post_only_book_max_age_ms` for the stale-book guard. The live
starter post-only configs use a 500 bps offset and fail request preparation if
the book is missing or stale.

Hyperliquid post-only configs can set `post_only_price_source` to
`hyperliquid_l2book_http` to fetch `POST /info` `l2Book` pricing instead of
opening another book WebSocket. Use `post_only_price_refresh_ms` to control the
cache TTL; the starter Hyperliquid configs refresh every five minutes.

For long-running taker sampling, use the venue-specific `*-taker-builder.json`
config and strict cleanup.

## Transport Policy

Use persistent WebSocket order submission whenever a venue has a verified
official order-entry WebSocket path. Hyperliquid and Lighter single, batch, and
taker configs use WebSocket for this reason. Aster and Extended currently use
HTTPS for order submission with WebSocket account-feed confirmation because the
verified official WebSocket docs cover market/private streams, not order-entry
submission.

## Account Commands

```bash
go run ./cmd/perps-bench accounts plan --venues hyperliquid,lighter
go run ./cmd/perps-bench accounts generate --venues hyperliquid,lighter --out .env.wallets.local
go run ./cmd/perps-bench accounts checklist --venues hyperliquid,lighter --env-file .env.wallets.local
go run ./cmd/perps-bench accounts check --venues hyperliquid,lighter --env-file .env.wallets.local
```

See `docs/credentials.md` for env-file details.

## Output Files

Write JSON/CSV results:

```bash
go run ./cmd/perps-bench run \
  --config examples/hyperliquid-builder.json \
  --env-file .env.wallets.local \
  --confirm-live \
  --output results/hyperliquid.json \
  --csv results/hyperliquid.csv
```

Summaries default to full response latency. To use TTFB:

```bash
--latency-mode ttfb
```

To measure private-stream confirmation instead of submit response:

```bash
--measurement-mode ws_confirmation
```

Compare saved result files:

```bash
go run ./cmd/perps-bench compare-results \
  results/hyperliquid.json \
  results/lighter.json
```

## Transports

Some venues support order submission over both HTTPS and WebSocket. Compare them
with:

```bash
go run ./cmd/perps-bench compare-transports \
  --config examples/hyperliquid-builder.json \
  --env-file .env.wallets.local \
  --transports https,websocket \
  --iterations 50 \
  --warmups 5 \
  --confirm-live \
  --output results/hyperliquid-transports.json
```

Unsupported transport/scenario combinations fail before the run starts.

## Continuous API

Run a benchmark continuously into a local SQLite store:

```bash
go run ./cmd/perps-bench run-continuous \
  --config examples/lighter-builder.json \
  --env-file .env.wallets.local \
  --transport websocket \
  --rate 0.0166667 \
  --chunk-iterations 1 \
  --cleanup-mode strict \
  --confirm-live \
  --store data/bench.db
```

Serve the read-only API:

```bash
go run ./cmd/perps-bench serve \
  --store data/bench.db \
  --listen 127.0.0.1:8080
```

Print the collector/API service topology before wiring process supervision:

```bash
go run ./cmd/perps-bench service-topology \
  --config examples/lighter-builder.json \
  --env-file .env.wallets.local \
  --exchange-tps-venue hyperliquid \
  --validate-binary ./perps-bench \
  --store data/bench.db \
  --listen 127.0.0.1:8080
```

Check a supervised deployment for failed services and stale accepted samples:

```bash
python3 scripts/service_watchdog.py --store data/bench.db
```

For transient venue/API outages that trip systemd start limits, operators can
explicitly reset and start failed benchmark services:

```bash
python3 scripts/service_watchdog.py --store data/bench.db --restart-failed
```

Expose it publicly with a password:

```bash
export PERPS_BENCH_API_PASSWORD='choose-a-long-password'

go run ./cmd/perps-bench serve \
  --store data/bench.db \
  --listen 0.0.0.0:8080 \
  --cors-origin ""
```

Check the API with:

```bash
curl -u "bench:$PERPS_BENCH_API_PASSWORD" \
  "http://YOUR_SERVER:8080/api/latest?window=5m"
```

## Dashboard

Start the read-only API:

```bash
go run ./cmd/perps-bench serve \
  --store data/bench.db \
  --listen 127.0.0.1:8080
```

Start the dashboard:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite, normally `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. The dashboard
keeps API credentials on the server side; they are not exposed to the browser.

For local development against an authenticated API, create `frontend/.dev.vars`:

```bash
PERPS_BENCH_API_URL=https://your-benchmark-api.example.com
PERPS_BENCH_API_USER=bench
PERPS_BENCH_API_PASSWORD=your-password
```

Deploy the dashboard:

```bash
cd frontend
npx wrangler secret put PERPS_BENCH_API_URL --config wrangler.jsonc
npx wrangler secret put PERPS_BENCH_API_PASSWORD --config wrangler.jsonc
npm run deploy:staging
```

The deployment flow uses `staging` as the local/default integration branch and
`main` as production. Pushes to `staging` deploy the separate Cloudflare Worker
`perps-latency-dashboard-staging` at
`https://staging-latency.perps.trading`; merges to `main` deploy production
`perps-latency-dashboard` at `https://latency.perps.trading`.

```bash
cd frontend
npm run deploy:staging
npm run deploy:production
```

Autodeploy can call the same npm scripts from the relevant branch. The Worker
runtime secrets `PERPS_BENCH_API_URL` and `PERPS_BENCH_API_PASSWORD` are set
directly in Cloudflare for each Worker environment.

## Safety

Live runs require `--confirm-live`.

Fill-likely order profiles, including market, IOC, FOK, and explicit
non-post-only orders, require `risk.allow_fill=true`,
`risk.neutralize_on_fill=true`, and strict after-sample cleanup. Start with
post-only/maker-style orders while validating setup.

Hyperliquid, Lighter, Aster, Extended, and Pacifica support cleanup of
benchmark orders. Cleanup runs outside the measured latency window. At startup,
venues with authenticated account reads check for stale orders from the same
`run_id`; after the run, those venues reconcile that no submitted benchmark
orders remain open and the position did not change. Pacifica currently prepares
per-sample WebSocket cancel requests by client order ID. Use strict cleanup when
cleanup failures should fail the sample:

```bash
--cleanup --cleanup-mode strict
```

Each live run also records a conservative network-floor estimate on every
sample. The estimate prefers clean same-route observations in this order:
WebSocket heartbeat RTT when the venue defines a safe heartbeat, real HTTP
request TCP connect timing when a fresh connection is opened, then rolling
low-percentile TCP connect timing to the same venue host and port as fallback.
Raw latency remains the default dashboard view; use the dashboard's "Subtract
network floor" toggle to inspect the optional network-adjusted view.

## Supported Venue Status

- Hyperliquid: HTTPS/WebSocket order submission, confirmation tracking, and
  cleanup.
- Lighter: HTTPS/WebSocket transaction submission, confirmation tracking, and
  cleanup.
- Aster: HTTPS order/batch submission, private WebSocket confirmation, and cleanup.
- Extended: HTTPS order submission, parallel single-order batch benchmark,
  private WebSocket confirmation, and cleanup.
- Pacifica: WebSocket order submission, native WebSocket batch benchmark,
  private WebSocket confirmation, and per-sample WebSocket cleanup.
- Bullet: WebSocket order submission, native WebSocket batch benchmark, book-top
  post-only pricing, cleanup by client order id, and account-feed confirmation.
  Batch orders are placed in one transaction under a single signature, so batch
  latency is not directly comparable with venues that sign each batch action
  individually. The taker config (`bullet-taker-builder.json`) cannot currently
  run: its fill-likely order profile trips the risk gate pending
  position-neutralization support for Bullet.

## Troubleshooting

- Missing env vars: run `accounts check` with the same `--env-file` flags you
  will use for the benchmark.
- Wrong wallet or key: run `accounts print` and compare the public identifiers
  with the venue UI.
- Lighter account errors: confirm `LIGHTER_ACCOUNT_INDEX`,
  `LIGHTER_API_KEY_INDEX`, and `LIGHTER_PRIVATE_KEY` match the active API key.
  If using maker-only mode, confirm `LIGHTER_MAKER_API_KEY_INDEX` is marked
  maker-only in Lighter.
- Lighter runner already active: use a separate Lighter API key for each
  concurrent runner, or stop the existing process using the same key.
- Config rejected for transport: the venue does not support that
  transport/scenario pair in this tool.
- Config rejected for risk: keep the order post-only while validating setup.
